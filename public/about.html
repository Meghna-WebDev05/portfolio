<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m Meghna, a 19-year-old student from the beautiful city of Ajmer, Rajasthan. <br/>I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA), where I’m diving deep into the world of technology<br/> and expanding my skills in coding and software development. I’m someone who’s naturally curious, with a love for <br/>learning and a good sense of humor that helps me connect easily with others.</p>

<p>Creativity has always been a big part of who I am. <br/>I enjoy painting, sketching, and writing—each of these hobbies gives me a different way to express myself and bring ideas to life.<br/> Whether I’m drawing detailed artwork or crafting short stories, I find peace and excitement in the creative process. <br/>On the flip side, I also have a strong interest in tech and logical thinking, <br/>which is what drew me to coding and computer science.</p>

<p>Outside of academics and art, I love playing badminton and exploring new creative projects.<br/> I consider myself a mix of playful and focused—always ready to learn, laugh, and try something new. <br/>Through this website, I hope to share my work,<br/> connect with like-minded people, and grow as both a creator and a coder.</p>
